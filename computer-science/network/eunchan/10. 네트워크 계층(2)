1. Ip datagram format
 - version
 - header length
 - type of service
 - length
 - identifier(16bit)
 - flgs
 - fragment offset
 - upper layer
 - options
 - source ip addr(32bit)/ dest ip addr(32bit)
 - time to live
 - header chedksum
 - data(segment or datagram)
 - 대부분의 패킷은 기본 사이즈인 40byte (Ack Packet)
 
2. Ip address(IPv4)
 - A unique 32 bit number
 - identifies an interface
 - represented in dotted-quad notation
 
 (1) Scalability Challnge
  - suppose hosts had arbitary addresses?
    > then every router would need a lot of information
  - hierarchical addressing : ip prefixes
    > network and host portions (left and right)
  - scalability imporved
    > number related hosts from a common subnet

 (2) classful addressing(in the old day)
  - only fixed allocation sizes
  - class A(/8 -> 2^24), class B(/16 -> 2/^16), class C(/24 -> 2/^12)
 
 (3) classless inter-domain routing(CIDR)
  - use two 32-bit numbers to represent a network
  - network number = ip address + mask
  
 (4) longest prefix match forwarding
  - destination-based forwarding
    > router identifies longest-matching prefix
    > cute algorithmic problem : very fast lookups
  - ex : dest = 201.10.6.17
         forwarding table = 4.0.0.0/8, 4.73.128.0/17, 201.10.6.17/23
         -> search 201.10.6.17
         
  (5) subnets
   - subnet part - high order bits
   - host part - low order bits
   - device interfaces with same subnet part of ip address
   - can physically reach each other without intervending router
   - 라우터는 여러 서브넷에 걸쳐있음

 (6) network address translation (NAT)
   - rewrites the ip address
    > make "insied" look like single ip addr
    > change header checksums accordingly
