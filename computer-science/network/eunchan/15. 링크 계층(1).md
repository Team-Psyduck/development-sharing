## 1. Introduction
   - terminology
     - hosts and routers : node
     - communication channels that connect adjacent nodes along communication path; link
       (wired links, wireless links, lans)
     - layere-2 packet : frame, encapsulates datagram(packet)
   - data-link layer has responsibility of transferring datagram from one node to physically adjacent node over a link
   
 (1) Where is the link layer implemented
   - in each and every host
   - link layer implemented in "adaptor" (NIC)
   - attaches into host's system buses
   - combination of hardware, software, firmware
   
 (2) Adaptors communicating
   - sending side :
     - encapsulates datagram in frame
     - adds error checking bits, rdt, flow control, etc..
   - receiving side :
     - looks for errors, rdt, flow control, etc..
     - extracts datagram(packet), passes to upper layer at receiving side

## 2. Multiple access links, protocols (Medium Access Control : MAC)
 (1) two types of links
   - point to point
     - PPP for dial-up access
     - point-to-point link between ehternet switch, host
   - broadcast (shared wire or medium)
     - old-fashioned ethernet
     - upstream HFC
     - 802.11 wireless LAN
   
 (2) An ideal multiple access protocol
   - given : broadcast channel of rate R bps
   - desire :
      - when one node wants to transmit, it can send at rate R
      - when M nodes want to transmit, each can send at average rate R/M
      - fully decentralized
        - no special node to coordinate transmission
        - no synchronization of clocks, slots
      - simple
      
 (3) MAC procols: taxonomy
   - channel partitioning
     - devide channel into smaller "pieces" (time slots, frequency, code)
     - allocate piece to node for exclusive use
   - random access
     - channel not divided, allow collisions
     - recover from collisions
   - taking turns
     - nodes take turns, but nodes with more to send can take longer turns
 
 (4) Channel PArtitioning MAC protocols : TDMA (Time division multiple access)
   - access to channel in rounds
   - each station gets fixed langth slot (length = pkt trans time) in each round
   - unused slots go idle
   - example : 6-station LAN, 1, 3, 4 have pkt, slots 2, 5, 6 idle
   
 (5) Channel partitioning MAC procols : FDMA (Frequency division multiple access)
   - channel spectrum divided into frequency bands
   - each station assigned fixed frequency band
   - unused transmission time in frequency bands go idle
   - example : 6 station LAN, 1, 3, 4 have pkt. frequency bands 2, 5, 6 idle
   
 (6) Random access Protocols
   - when nodes has packet to send
     - transmit at full channel data rate R.
     - no a priori coordination among nodes
   - two or more transmitting nodes -> "collision"
   - random access MAC procol specifies :
     - how to detect collisions
     - how to recover from collision
   - examples of random access MAC procols:
     - slotted ALOHA, ALOHA, CSMA, CSAMA/CD, CSMA/CA
 
 (7) CSMA (carrier sense multiple access)
   - lissten before transmit :
     - if channel sensed idle : transmit entire frame
       - if channel sensed busy, defer transmission
       - human analogy: don't interrupt athors
   - CSMA collisions
     - collisions can still occur : propagation delay means two nodes may not hear each other's transmission
     - collision: entire packet reansmission tme wasted
       - distance & propagation delay play role in determining collision probability
 
 (8) CSMA/CD (collision detection)
   - carrier sending, deferral as in CSMA
     - collision detected within short time
     - colliding transmissions aborted, reducing channel wastage
   - collision detection :
     - easy in wired LAns : measure signal strength, compare transmitted, received signats
     - difficult in wirelss LANs : received signal strength overwhelmed by local transmission strength
   - human analogy: the polite conversationalist
   - algotrithm
     - NIC receives datagram from network layer, creates frame
     - if NIC senses channel idle, starts frame trnasmission. if NIC senses channel busy, waits until channel idle, thne transmits.
     - if NIC transmits entire frame without detecting another transmission, NIC is done with frame
     - if NIC detects another transmission while transmitting, aborts and sends jam signal
     - afther aborting, NIC enters binary backoff
       - after mth collision, NIC chooses K at random from. NIC waits K-512 vit times, returns to Step 2
       - longer backoff interval with more collisions
     > 복잡해보이지만, 그냥 충돌 횟수에 따라 오래 기다린다는 뜻일 뿐임
     > 나 말고도 계속해서 보내는 클라이언트가 있다는 뜻이기 때문에 오래 기다리는 것이 안전하기 때문
  
 (9) Tacking turns MAC protcols
   - polling
     - master nod invites stave nodes to transmit in turn
     - typically used with dumb slave devices
     - concerns : 
       - polling overhead
       - latency
       - single point of failure
   
   - token passing
     - control token passed from one node to next sequentially
     - token message
     - concerns
       - token overhead
       - latency
       - single point of failure

  (10) conclusion
    - RandomAccess(CSMA/CD) 방식이 가장 주로 사용된다.
