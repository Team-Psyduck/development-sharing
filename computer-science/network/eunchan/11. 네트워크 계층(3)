네트워크 계층(3)

1. Network Address Translation(NAT)
  (1) example
   (NAT transalation table)
   WAN side addr           | LAN side addr
   138.76.29.7.5001          10.0.4
   138.76.29.7.5002          10.0.5

  (2) problem
   - Routers are not supposed to look at port #s
     > network layer should care only about ip header
     > and not be looking at the port numbers at all
   - NAT violates the end-to-end arguement
     > network node should not modify the packet
   - IPv6 is a cleaner solution
     > better to migrate than to limp along with a hack
  
2. Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol(DHCP)
  (1) example
    IP : 192.168.1.47
    Mask : 255.255.255.0
    router : 192.168.1.1
    DNS : 192.168.1.1
    > subnet : 192.168.1.0
    > IP, Mask, Router, DNS는 누가 설정했는가? DHCP
   
  (2) how dose a host get ip addr?
   - hard-coded by system admin in a file
   - DHCP : dynamically get address from as server
   
  (3) significance
   - can renew its lease on addr in use
   - allows reuse of addresses
   - support for mobile users how want to join network
   
  (4) DHCP(일반적으로 local router) client-server scenario
   - host : broadcasts "DHCP discover"
   - DHCP server : responsds with "DHCP offer"
   - host : requests ip addr "DHCP request"
   - DHCP server : sends address "DHCP ack"
   
   (5) Conclusion
   - 통신사에서 네트워크 IP를 할당 받는다면?
   - NAT, DHCP, DNS 모두 하나의 모뎀(라우터)에서 동작
   
   (6) IP fragmentation, reassembly
   - example
    > 4000byte datagram
    > MTU = 1500bytes
    > fragmentation : 1500(flag=1, offset=0), 1500(flag=1, offset=185), 1040(flag=0, offset=370)
   - loss?
    > reassembly fail -> tcp 재전송
